# Current Event Project 2022

## Overview

For a project at school, I had to read an article that was based on two students debating on if schools should keep letter grades or remove them. Based on the article, I had to make a project to state my opinion using whatever strategy I could use. I had thought that if I tied Iot along with my project, it would make my project uniqe to the look and for presentation and also have a much more fun experience in the making than if you were to make a poster.

## Tech 

```javascript
var elem = document.getElementById("button");
elem.prop("disabled",true);
```

 </table>
