# Current Event Project 2022

## Overview

For a project at school, I had to read an article that was based on two students debating on if schools should keep letter grades or remove them. Based on the article, I had to make a project to state my opinion using whatever strategy I could use. I had thought that if I tied ioT along with my project, it would make my project uniqe to the look and for presentation and also have a much more fun experience in the making than if you were to make a poster.

## What is on the display?

On my display, it will show the 4 buttons(more or less based on your design) so that when I need to, I can just press the button then it will play that sound. When ever I click on a button, then I have made it so that the other buttons will be disabled so that if I accedently press another button, then it won't be afected since it is disabled. Then on the bottom of the screen, it says that is connected to the server. This design can work offline, so you can bring it anywhere!
